# finger_tremor_project
This project requires a 3D printed container for an Arduino Uno and a circuit that will allow for the detection of finger tremors. We will accomplish this task using a light source and light sensitive electrical element that will detect when the tremoring finger affects the light pathway. It will be beautiful.
